**Looker - LookML - Data Analysis - BI - Dashboard**

Looker is a tool that helps us to see the data our company collects which should make our work life easier and effective.

Looker is unique that after our company setsup, we can explore our company's data without knowing any special knowledge which unlocks lot of power which we can take advantage of.

As we all know, every company data is different. So lets take an example of Housing. 

Assume we are working at Housing retailer and want to know better understand our house sales. So we can create saved report called Dashboard. Now if we were in charge of managing our housing inventory then Looker is a pretty great tool to start the day. From this is where Looker starts to get interesting. Lets say we are only interested in Peel region(Toronto). We can quickly make that change in the tool and Run and see the results and if that is important to we can schedule it to show up in our email every morning using Looker and we can also send that email to our colleagues or to a various services or even we can download it. 

So now we are not guessing. if some one asks about how housing inventory is doing we'll know exactly. This tool is very good in Data Exploration.

Getting our questions answered as we have them, so we can make speedy, error-free and informed-decisions.
