LookML Projects
  A LookML Project is a group of model, view, and dashboard files that are generally version controlled at once via a Git repository. 
    The model files contain data about which db tables to use, and how they should be joined together. 
    The view files contain data about how to calculate information about each db table.

LookML separates structure from content, so the query structure (how tables are joined) is independent of the query content 
(the columns to access, derived fields, aggregate functions to compute, and filtering expressions to apply).

LookML syntax has a structure that is clear and easy to learn. 

LookML and IDE folder names are case-sensitive.

Setting up a LookML project involves 3 main steps:
  1. Creating a database connection to access the data.
  2. Creating and configuring a project to hold our data model.
  3. And Setting up version control to manage the changes to the data model.
