Define LookML?::
      LookML is a language for representing dimensions, aggregates, calculations, and data relationships in a SQL database. 
      Looker uses a model written in LookML to construct SQL queries against a particular database.

Will represent our database in a model once and individuals without in-depth database knowledge can explore the data for themselves.
The language which allows this is called LookML.

For a long time the fundamental language of data analytics has been SQL and its well known language for many analysts and developers. 
LookML is massively SQl based, still friendly to any one who has SQL experience, but LookML is modular and reusable.

Some of the fundamentals of LookML before we get started with LookML in detail like:
        Parameters : LookML is made up of parameters to which we assign values either single or multiple values besides few parameters can 
                     accept other parameters using curly braces.
        Comments: Just notes or text which we want to include with a number sign (#), but they aren’t part of the LookML.
                  No more LookML will occur on that row once Comments are initiated.
        Spacing: LookML never bother about extra spaces.
        Indentation: LookML neither care about indentation too, meanwhile using correct indentation will help a lot with readability of LookML.
        Lines: LookML doesn't mind about empty lines, but it does care about putting each parameter on its own line.
  
LookML Projects::
        A LookML Project is a group of model, view, and dashboard files that are generally version controlled at once via a Git repository. 
        The model files contain data about which db tables to use, and how they should be joined together. 
        The view files contain data about how to calculate information about each db table.

   LookML separates structure from content, so the query structure (how tables are joined) is independent of the query content 
        (the columns to access, derived fields, aggregate functions to compute, and filtering expressions to apply).
        LookML splits content of queries from structure of queries.
        LookML syntax has a structure that is clear and easy to learn. 
      
SQL Queries Generated by Looker::
        For business users, focusing only on the content they need the ability to create complex queries in Looker, 
        but not the complexities of SQL structure.
        For data analysts, LookML encourages DRY style (“don’t repeat yourself”), meaning we write SQL queries once, 
        in one place, and Looker uses the code frequently to generate ad-hoc SQL queries spontaneously. 
        A query built in Looker will joins values from multiple tables. 

Describe Data Structures using Dependency language::
        LookML is a dependency language compared to essential language like C, Java, C++ so on.
        LookML supply predefined data types and syntax for data modeling. LookML syntax has a structure that is clear and easy to learn. 
        LookML is independent of particular SQL dialects(MSSQL/MYSQL/Oracle and so on), and encapsulates SQL expressions to support any SQL implementation.

LookML Is Case-Sensitive::
        LookML is case-sensitive, so be sure to match the case when referring to LookML elements, 
        if not Looker will warn you if you are referring to element which doesn't exist and also suggests name which is existing .
        The same repeats with IDE folder names as well as they are case-sensitive too.
