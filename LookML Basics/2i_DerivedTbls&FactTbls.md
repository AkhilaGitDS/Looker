**+Derived Tables: +**

A derived table is a table containing values from other tables; it is retrieved as though it were a physical table with its own set of columns. A derived table is exposed as its own view using the derived_table parameter, and defines dimensions and measures in the same manner as conventional views. The view for a derived table can be queried and joined into other views, just like any other view.
