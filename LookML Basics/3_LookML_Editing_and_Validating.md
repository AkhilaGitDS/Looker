**+Editing and validating LookML Using the IDE: +**

Looker’s integrated development environment (IDE) has various features to help us in writing LookML.

+*Autosuggest:-*+
As we type, the IDE advise possible parameters and values that are sensitive to the conditions of what we are typing. 
For example, the advises for a dimension’s type parameter will only include valid options for that parameter. Also, fields in sql parameters have to be marked with ${...}, so the IDE adds that syntax when suggesting fields.
