**+Database Connection: +**
Looker supplies queries against a database, as said in the LookML model file. A Looker connection says a server hosting the database, and parameters defining how Looker should connect to the database. Database setup is usually done once (or infrequently) by the system administrator, and data modelers directly pick from the available connections.
