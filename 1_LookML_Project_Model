A model references a combination of related explores. Unlike other LookML elements, a model is not declared explicitly with the model keyword.
      model: {
      access_grant: identifier
      case_sensitive: yes or no
      connection: "string"
      datagroup: identifier
      explore: identifier
      fiscal_month_offset: number
      include: "string"
      label: possibly-localized-string
      map_layer: identifier
      named_value_format: identifier
      persist_for: "string"
      persist_with: datagroup-ref
      test: identifier
      view: identifier
      week_start_day: monday or ...

Models - Models are the place where we will define our explores. In general weâ€™ll have one model per database. 
         However, models can be used to control various types of data access, so we might break this rule. 
         Models are stored in model files. The model name is the name of the file.
         By definition, there is only one model per model file. This is because we create a model by creating its file. 
    
Explores - Explores define which views will be shown in the Explore menu at the top of Looker. 
           You can also define join relationships between multiple views to create explores that contain information from multiple views.
           Explores live inside of models.
