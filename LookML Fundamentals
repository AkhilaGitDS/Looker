Define LookML?
  LookML is a language for illustrating dimensions, aggregates, calculations, and data relationships in a SQL database. 
  Looker uses a model written in LookML to construct SQL queries against a particular database.
Describe your database in a model once, and the people without much database knowledge can explore the data for themselves. 
And the language created to implement this is called LookML.
  
Some of the fundamentals of LookML before we get started with LookML in detail like:
  Parameters : LookML is made up of parameters to which we assign values either single or multiple values besides few parameters can accept other parameters using curly braces.
  Comments: Just notes or text which we want to include with a number sign (#), but they arenâ€™t part of the LookML.
            No more LookML will occur on that row once Comments are initiated.
  Spacing: LookML never bother about extra spaces.
  Indentation: LookML neither care about indentation too, meanwhile using correct indentation will help a lot with readability of LookML.
  Lines: LookML doesn't mind about empty lines, but it does care about putting each parameter on its own line.
