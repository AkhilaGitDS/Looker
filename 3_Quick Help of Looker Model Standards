Model::
        connection :- connection specifies the database connection from which a model will retrieve data. 
        Database connections are defined and named in Looker's Admin settings. A model may only use one connection.
        connection: "string"
        
        include :- use include "file_name_glob" to access views, explores, and other symbols defined in another file.
        Use a file name or standard glob syntax: *, ?, [abc], [a-z], and [! ] are supported.
        include: "string"
        
        explore :- explore adds an existing view to the Explore menu of Looker. 
                   Although an explore can be written inside of a view file, it is always best practice to write it within a model file instead.

                   label :- label changes the way that this explore will appear in the Explore menu. 
                            Unless specified, the label defaults to the name of the explore with underscores replaced with spaces and each word capitalized.

                   group_label :- group_label can be used to create custom groups of explores in the explore picker. 
                                  Defaults to the label of the model.
