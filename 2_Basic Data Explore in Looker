We need 2 items to make our data explorable in Looker: a view and a model.

The View::
            Generally, every view communicate with one table in our database and they can also communicate to a table that we create in Looker.
            views can hold dimensions which means columns in a table and views can also represent transformations of those columns.
            views lives in files. Below is simple example for view::

                  view: lesson_1_names {                                         # Create a view called "lesson_1" say which data table "names" relies on
                  sql_table_name: `fh-bigquery.popular_names.usa_1910_2013`;;    # 'sql_table_name' parameter connect this view with a database table.

                  dimension: name {         # Create a dimension called "name"
                    type: string            # Declare that "name" has a data type of string
                    sql: ${TABLE}.name ;;   # Declare that "name" takes the value of the "name" column from this view's table
                  }                         # ${TABLE} is used to reference the viewâ€™s database table, which is a good way to keep the table defined exactly in one spot.

                  dimension: gender {       # Create a dimension called "gender"
                    type: string            # Declare that "gender" has a data type of string
                    sql: ${TABLE}.gender ;; # Declare that "gender" takes the value of the "gender" column from this view's table
                  }                           

                  dimension: state {        # Create a dimension called "state"
                    type: string            # Declare that "state" has a data type of string
                    sql: ${TABLE}.state ;;  # Declare that "state" takes the value of the "state" column from this view's table
                  }                         

                  dimension: year {         # Create a dimension called "year"
                    type: number            # Declare that "year" has a data type of number
                    sql: ${TABLE}.year ;;   # Declare that "year" takes the value of the "year" column from this view's table
                  }                       

                  dimension: population {   # Create a dimension called "population" 
                    type: number            # Declare that "population" has a data type of number
                    sql: ${TABLE}.number ;; # Declare that "population" takes the value of the "number" column from this view's table
                  }                         
                }

The Model::
              Once view is created, we should inform Looker that it should be explorable and we do that in model.
              Models carry explores, which means the views end-users should be able to communicate with. 
              They can also define how various views can connect together into richer explores.
              Models also live in files and below is the basic example for model::
                    
                    connection: "lookerdata_publicdata"  # Define which database connection to use
                    include: "*.view.lkml"               # Include all views in this model

                    # Create an explorable item based on the "lesson_1_names" view
                    explore: lesson_1_names {

                      # Give the explore a user-friendly name in the Explore menu
                      label: "1. Basic Views and Models"

                      # Place this explore under a "Name Game" header in the explore menu
                      group_label: "Name Game"
                    }
                    
Now end users, can start exploring our database information via View through Model.
